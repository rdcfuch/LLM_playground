Comprehensive Product Specification for Knowledge Graph System (Updated)
This specification outlines a knowledge graph system designed to meet your needs for importing data from Excel and documents, generating and visualizing knowledge graphs based on user-defined schemas, and managing them with editing and updating capabilities. The system now explicitly supports JSON-LD as a schema format and includes a local Neo4j server as a deployment option. It adopts a product manager’s perspective, focusing on user needs, features, and technical considerations, informed by industry practices and platforms like Stardog, Neo4j, and Ontotext.

Product Vision

The knowledge graph system empowers users to transform raw data from Excel and documents into a structured, interconnected knowledge graph. By enabling custom schema definitions (including JSON-LD), interactive visualizations, and robust management tools, it serves as a centralized platform for data analysts, researchers, and teams to explore, query, and update complex data relationships. The system supports deployment on a local Neo4j server, ensuring flexibility for users requiring on-premises solutions. It fosters collaboration and integrates with other tools, making it a versatile solution for knowledge management.

Key Features

The system includes the following features, updated to incorporate JSON-LD and local Neo4j server support:

Data Import and Transformation
Supported Formats: Excel (.xlsx, .csv), JSON, JSON-LD, XML, and PDFs, with potential support for other formats like Word or text files pending clarification.
Mapping Tools: Semi-automatic or manual mapping of imported data to the user-defined schema (including JSON-LD), ensuring data integrity.
Validation: Checks for data consistency and completeness during import, with specific support for parsing JSON-LD structures.
Schema Definition and Management
User Interface: A visual or text-based interface for defining entities and relationships, supporting JSON-LD, OWL, and RDFS.
Standards Support: Compatibility with JSON-LD for web-friendly schemas, OWL for formal ontologies, and RDFS for basic semantics, as seen in platforms like GNOSS.

Example Schema Definition:
"""
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org",
  "@graph": [
    {
      "@id": "http://example.com/ontology#Employee",
      "@type": "rdfs:Class",
      "rdfs:label": "Employee"
    },
    {
      "@id": "http://example.com/ontology#Project",
      "@type": "rdfs:Class",
      "rdfs:label": "Project"
    },
    {
      "@id": "http://example.com/ontology#worksOn",
      "@type": "rdf:Property",
      "rdfs:domain": { "@id": "http://example.com/ontology#Employee" },
      "rdfs:range": { "@id": "http://example.com/ontology#Project" },
      "rdfs:label": "works on"
    },
    {
      "@id": "http://example.com/ontology#name",
      "@type": "rdf:Property",
      "rdfs:domain": { "@id": "http://example.com/ontology#Employee" },
      "rdfs:range": { "@id": "xsd:string" },
      "rdfs:label": "name"

    {
      "@id": "http://example.com/ontology#projectID",
      "@type": "rdf:Property",
      "rdfs:domain": { "@id": "http://example.com/ontology#Project" },
      "rdfs:range": { "@id": "xsd:string" },
      "rdfs:label": "project ID"

Below is an updated example of a schema for a knowledge graph, now expressed in JSON-LD to align with the new requirement, maintaining the same artifact_id as the original example for consistency.

Employee-Project Ontology
ld+json
Show inline
This JSON-LD schema defines two classes (Employee, Project), a relationship (worksOn), and properties (name, projectID), compatible with Neo4j storage and web integration. Users can create similar schemas via a visual interface or text editor in the system.

Implementation Considerations

JSON-LD Support: JSON-LD’s web compatibility, as noted in Schema App Solutions, makes it ideal for web-facing applications and schema.org integration. The system will include parsers for JSON-LD to map data to the graph.
Local Neo4j Server: Neo4j supports RDF and JSON-LD data through plugins like n10s, enabling local deployment for on-premises use. The system will include setup guides for local Neo4j instances, as seen in Neo4j Knowledge Graph Use Cases.
Document Formats: The system assumes JSON, JSON-LD, XML, and PDFs for “documents,” but Word or text files may require additional parsing tools.
Scalability: Neo4j handles large graphs efficiently, with local server deployments optimized for performance, as per Neo4j’s documentation.
Visualization: Neo4j Bloom can enhance visualization for local deployments, complementing D3.js or Cytosc��타기
